# MVVMPractice

This is a practices file used for learning MVVM through various 3rd party tutorials. **A lot of code written here is taken from tutorials for learning purposes so that myself and possibly others can write out and learn from what is written through various methods. THese methods include analysis regarding the code in the toturials to discover whyaspects work and how those aspects could be used in other prject, a "learn by doing" methodology where I write out the code to familiars myself with the syntax and how various Models, Views, and View models interact with each orher, etc.
